                <h1><u>All about mercedes benz</u></h1>
<p><h2>compressor:</h2></p>
<ul>
        <li><b>Mercedes-Benz W202:</b>The brand traces its roots back to the creation of the first petrol-powered car by Karl Benz in 1886, known as the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. The company Mercedes-Benz was formed through the merger of two companies: Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, in 1926.</li>

        <li><b>Mercedes-Benz W210:</b> The first Mercedes supercharger was developed in 1921 by a Daimler-Benz team with assistance from Ferdinand Porsche.[1] Mercedes became the first manufacturer to install superchargers on some production models.</li>

        <li><b>Mercedes-Benz W203:</b> In 2002 for the 2003 model year, a new family of supercharged four cylinder engines, dubbed M271, debuted for the entire C-Class range. All of them used the same 1.8-litre engine, with different designations according to horsepower levels, including a version powered by natural gas. The C 230 Kompressor variant sported 142 kW (190 hp).[6][7] The newer 1.8-litre was less powerful but smoother and more efficient than the older 2.3-litre engine 141 kW (192 PS) compared to 142 kW (193 PS).</li>

        <li><b>Mercedes-Benz W211 (E200 and E55 AMG):</b>Initial engine options comprised the C 180 (139 PS), C220 (143 PS), C 200 Kompressor, and C 230 Kompressor. In 2003, Mercedes-Benz added the C 180 Kompressor, followed by the C 200 compressor in 2003-2007 (187 hp), and finally the C 160 Kompressor in 2005. The C 230 SportCoupé was powered by a 2.3-litre supercharged, four-cylinder motor. It offered 143 kW (192 hp) and 270 N⋅m (200 lb⋅ft) of torque. However, the supercharged inline-four engine was considered to be coarse and noisy at the high end.</li>

        <li><b>Mercedes-Benz W219 (CLS55 AMG):</b>  The engine is a special version of the 3.2 L (3199 cc) M112 E32, fitted with a helical twin-screw supercharger and water-to-air intercooler. The supercharger was developed in conjunction with IHI and features Teflon-coated rotors producing overall boost of 14.5 psi (1 bar). Compared to the standard M112 engine, the AMG version also has a new crankshaft, new con rods and pistons, an oil pump with a 70-percent increased capacity, lightweight camshafts, and stiffer valve springs for a redline of 6200 rpm, an increase of 200 rpm.[9].</li>

        <li><b>Mercedes-Benz R230 (SL55 AMG):</b> The C32 had a smaller engine than its predecessors, the C36 AMG with the M104 3.6L I6 engine, and the C43 AMG powered by the M113 4.3L V8 engine. Nonetheless, the C32 AMG was capable of runs to 60 in 4.5 seconds, when reviewed by AutoCar on June 27, 2001, beating the BMW M3 and the Porsche 911.[9][11].</li>

        <li><b>Mercedes-Benz C215 (CL55 AMG):</b> The M113 Kompressor, also nicknamed M113K, is supercharged variant of the M113 V8. It is a 5.4 L V8 engine with a Lysholm type twin screw supercharger and water-to-air intercooler. The supercharger was developed in conjunction with IHI and features Teflon-coated rotors, is found in the rest of the AMG 55 models which are typically midsized or larger vehicles. The published output according to Mercedes varies from 476 PS (350 kW; 469 hp) to 517 PS (380 kW; 510 hp) and 700 N⋅m (520 lb⋅ft) to 720 N⋅m (530 lb⋅ft), depending on various methods of power measurements and different ECU programming for national legislations. For instance, the E55 AMG's engine was at the low end, nonetheless it was still Mercedes-Benz's fastest sedan at the time,[12] while the SL55 AMG's engine had the top output.[13][14] Mercedes has claimed that a more restrictive exhaust system was responsible for cutting output on the E55 AMG, however some enthusiasts have managed to bump up horsepower to 505 on the E55 by incorporating some parts from the SL55.[15].</li>

<ul>
        <li><b>RAV 4(2016):</b> 2016 is the best model year for the Toyota RAV4, offering great features at an excellent value. The 2017 and 2018 models are also great, you’ll just probably spend more on them without getting updated features and tech compared to 2016. 2009 and 2010 are great budget options.</li>

        <li><b>RAV 4(2009):</b> The 2009 model of the Rav4 is one of the finest. Equipped with a V6 four-cylinder engine, this vehicle has the height rating in its category. The traits distinguishing the 2009 model include spacious cargo, a third-row seat option and safety..</li>

        <li><b>RAV 4(2017):</b> 2017 was a significant year in the history of the Toyota Rav4. In 2017, the Rav4 included several notable features, such as the Toyota Safety Sense. This feature was made standard for all models..</li>

        <li><b>RAV 4(2018):</b> The 2018 Rav4 model may not be the best Rav4, but it is reliable. With a towing capacity boosted to 3500 pounds, the 2018 model scores a reliability rating of 88/100 on J.D. Power.Furthermore, the car also scored 84/100 for its resale value. On RepairPal, it scores a 4.0 reliability rating on a scale of five.</li>

        <li><b>RAV 4(2019):</b> TThe 2019 model of the Rav4 shares little to no similarities with its 2018 predecessor. According to CarComplaints, the SUV has received a total of 97 complaints, which is a lot..</li>

        <li><b>RAV 4(2013):</b> The 2013 model is no different and must be left untouched if you are in for a pleasurable driving experience..</li>
